This project is intended to demonstrate a simple LORA use case in which the content of a drawer 
is tracked by measuring it's weight. It is created to be used with an 
[Arduino DUE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardDue) in combination with an Dragino
[Lora-Shield](http://wiki.dragino.com/index.php?title=Lora_Shield) and 
[Load-Sensors](http://www.digikey.de/short/3rndqf) connected via voltage devider.

To compile this project you need to install [platformio](http://platformio.org). After installing run:
```
platformio run
```

This will download all dependencies and build a version
